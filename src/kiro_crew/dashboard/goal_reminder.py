"""A crewmate's check-ins: Daily Goal Reminder, Weekly report, Monthly review.

The Goals tab's three switches (``PUT /api/members/{slug}/goals/schedules``) are
stored in the goal record (:mod:`kiro_crew.member_goals`), and each switch keeps
exactly ONE gateway-owned schedule in step with it, through the cron store's
installer key (``managed_by``, ``goal-<cadence>:<slug>``), so no switch can ever
have two schedules and none touches another's:

* on -> that cadence's old schedule (if any) is removed and a fresh one created
  at the shared time of day: daily ``M H * * *``, weekly ``M H * * <weekday>``,
  monthly ``M H <day> * *``, in the user's timezone;
* off -> that cadence's schedule is removed.

When a schedule fires, the gateway's cron callback hands the job here
(:func:`fire`) instead of running it as an ordinary cron turn: the prompt is
built from the CURRENT goal record and dispatched as one gateway-authored turn
in the crewmate's pinned thread (:func:`mate_welcome.dispatch_hidden_turn`), so
the user sees only the crewmate's reply. That turn is not one the user sent, so
``update_self`` and most cards refuse inside it; the goal tools (readings,
``save_goal_report``) are admitted there on purpose
(``handlers.member_goals``), and so are the crewmate's own goal, milestones and
check-ins cards (``set_goal``, ``set_key_results``, ``set_check_ins``), which
any turn in its own thread may raise (``handlers.guide.REQ_OWN_GOAL_TURN``).
Nothing changes until the user presses the card.

The weekly and monthly prompts carry the tasks the crewmate finished in the
period, read from its work ledger (the same items the Crew board shows,
:func:`finished_tasks`). The weekly and monthly turns end with ``save_goal_report``: the gateway saves the
report as an artifact under ``Crewmates/<name>/Reports`` (:func:`save_report`),
remembers it on the goal record, and sends one notification linking it; the
crewmate's reply in the thread is one short line, never the report itself.

A check-in that fires with the thread closed, a turn already running, its switch
off or no goal left does nothing that time.
